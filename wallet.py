Okay, here's a basic cryptocurrency wallet application in Python, aiming for around 502 strings (including comments, variable names, and output).  It focuses on key generation, address derivation, and a very simplified "transaction" simulation.  It's a conceptual example and **not suitable for real-world use** due to security vulnerabilities and missing features. I'll explain the code thoroughly.

```python
import secrets
import hashlib
import base58

# --- Configuration ---
NETWORK_PREFIX = b'\x00'  # Bitcoin Mainnet prefix (example)
